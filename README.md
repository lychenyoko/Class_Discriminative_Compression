This repository contains the codes for *Class-Discriminative CNN Compression*, which is published in ICPR2022.

## Overview

<a><img src='Assets/CDC_Flow_Chart.png' width=1100></a>

We propose two class-discriminative based network compression techniques, class-discriminative pruning and class-discriminative distillation which fits seamlessly with the class-discriminative training goal. 

## Usage

### Working Environment

We have tested our codes with the following setups:

```
python==3.6.5
tensorflow==1.14.0
numpy==1.16.0
```
